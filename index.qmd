# Preface {.unnumbered}

Data science is everywhere around us—from the maps that guide our
commutes, to the movie recommendations we receive, to the health and
environmental reports that help shape public policy. Yet for many
students, data science feels distant, complicated, or reserved for
college courses. This book takes the opposite view. With the right
tools and a curious mindset, anyone—especially high school
students—can begin doing real data science today.


The goal of this book is to show you what data science actually looks
like in practice. It focuses not on memorizing formulas, but on
learning how to set up your computer correctly, organize your work,
use modern tools such as the command line, Git, VSCodium, and Quarto,
and build reproducible analyses from day one. These skills form the
foundation of professional data science, and developing them early
will allow you to create insights that matter.


Throughout the book, you will work with real datasets from topics you
already care about: sports, the environment, health, city life, and
more. You will learn how to explore the data, ask thoughtful
questions, create visualizations, and communicate your findings
clearly. Just as importantly, you will learn how to manage your work
like a professional data scientist, building good habits that will
serve you through college and beyond.


This book assumes no prior experience with programming or
statistics. What it does assume is curiosity, patience, and a
willingness to try. You will write your first command-line commands,
make your first Git commits, produce your first Quarto report, and
build your first real project—all in Part I. Part II will invite you
to discover patterns in real-world datasets through guided examples.


My hope is that this book helps you see data science not as something
mysterious, but as something you can do, enjoy, and grow with. Every
data scientist started where you are now—with a blank screen, an open
mind, and a desire to understand the world better.


Welcome to your journey into data science.
