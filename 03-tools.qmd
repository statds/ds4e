# Right Tools for Data Science Projects

## Introduction

This chapter introduces the tools required to carry out reproducible data
science projects in this course. A reproducible project is one in which the
full analysis --- data inputs, code, narrative, and results --- can be rerun
by someone else, or by the same analyst at a later time, with the same
outcomes. Reproducibility is therefore a property of an entire project rather
than of any single tool. The goal of this chapter is not to teach tools in
isolation, but to explain how a small set of tools work together to support
this project-level reproducibility.


Without a structured workflow, data science work tends to become fragile.
Files are renamed or overwritten, intermediate results are lost, and analysis
steps are no longer clear even to the original author. These problems become
more severe as projects grow in size or involve collaboration. In an academic
setting, they also make it difficult to review, grade, or extend work. The
tools introduced in this chapter are motivated by these common failure modes
and are chosen to prevent them in a systematic way.


The tools in this chapter form a coherent workflow rather than a loose
collection of software. Git records the history of a project and makes changes
explicit. GitHub provides a shared location for storing, submitting, and
reviewing projects. Quarto allows code, text, and results to live in a single
executable document. Python or R provides the computational engine for data
analysis. VS Code serves as a coordinating environment that brings these tools
together in daily work. Each tool plays a distinct role, and reproducibility
emerges from their interaction.


In this course, all homework and projects are treated as reproducible data
science projects. Submissions consist of files organized in a clear directory
structure, tracked with version control, and rendered into reproducible
documents. Screenshots, manually edited outputs, and undocumented analysis
steps are not acceptable substitutes. By the end of this chapter, you should
be able to set up a complete project, make changes in a controlled way, and
produce results that can be reliably reproduced and reviewed.


## Git: Version Control for Reproducible Projects

### Why Git?

Version control is a foundational skill for data science because it treats
your work as a living project with a complete history. Git lets you track
every change you make, recover from mistakes, and collaborate without
overwriting anyone’s work. Unlike saving multiple file versions by hand
(e.g., `project_final_v12_REAL`), Git provides a precise, automatic timeline
of your edits. This makes your work reproducible, auditable, and shareable,
which are essential habits for scientific computing and data science
projects.

Git is used to manage data science projects as evolving artifacts rather than one-time snapshots. Analyses typically change as
data are cleaned, models are revised, and interpretations improve. A Git
repository should contain only the files needed to understand, reproduce,
and extend a project---nothing more.

### Installing Git

Git must be installed before it can be used. Use the method appropriate
for your system.

* **Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
```

This installs Git together with **Git Bash**, a terminal environment used
throughout this book. Do not run `winget` inside Git Bash.

* **macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install git
```

* **Debian / Ubuntu Linux (including WSL):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

After installation, configure Git once so your work is properly attributed:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Verify that Git is installed and configured correctly:

```bash
git --version
git config --list
```

### Essential Git Commands

Git is most effective when you stage files deliberately and keep the
repository clean. The following commands form the core of everyday Git
usage in data science projects.

* `git init` initializes a repository in a project folder.
* `git status` shows which files have changed.
* `git add <file>` stages selected files to be recorded.
* `git commit -m "message"` saves a snapshot of staged changes.
* `git diff` displays differences between versions.
* `git push` sends committed changes to a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub.
* `git pull` retrieves updates from a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub.

These two commands are where Git connects to an online platform. A common
example of such a platform is GitHub, which serves as a shared location
for backing up work and collaborating on projects. The next section focuses
on GitHub itself and how it is used in our workflow.


Avoid using `git add .` as a default habit. It often stages generated
files, temporary outputs, or other unintended content. Staging files
explicitly helps keep repositories small, readable, and reproducible.

### Basic Workflow

Git works best when your project is organized as a single folder containing
scripts, Quarto files, and documentation. A typical workflow follows a
simple cycle: edit files, inspect what changed, stage selected files, and
commit them with a short message explaining what was done.

```bash
cd ds4hs
git init
git status
git add README.md
git add analysis.qmd
git commit -m "initial project structure"
```

Git can also connect your local project to a remote repository hosted
online. This idea is introduced above when discussing `git push` and
`git pull`, and it is developed in detail in the next section, which
focuses on GitHub as a concrete example of an online hosting platform.


### Good Practices for Git

Good Git usage is less about memorizing commands and more about developing
clean, repeatable habits. The following practices are especially important
for reproducible data science projects:

* **Keep the repository clean.** Track only files that are needed to
  understand, reproduce, and extend the project. Avoid committing
  generated files, rendered outputs, large raw datasets, or temporary
  artifacts unless they are explicitly required.

* **Stage files deliberately.** Add files explicitly rather than staging
  everything at once. This helps prevent accidental inclusion of
  unnecessary or generated content.

* **Commit small, logical changes.** Each commit should represent a
  coherent step in the project, making the history easier to read and
  reason about.

* **Write informative commit messages.** A short message explaining what
  changed and why is more valuable than a vague description.

* **Use `.gitignore` consistently.** The `.gitignore` file is the primary
  mechanism for keeping a repository clean over time. It tells Git which
  files should never be tracked, such as temporary outputs, cache
  directories, and system-specific files.


## GitHub: Hosting and Collaboration for Git Projects

### What GitHub Is and Why It Matters

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories. Git manages
project history on your computer, while GitHub stores a synchronized copy
online. GitHub adds four capabilities that local Git alone does not
provide.

* Backup: a remote copy protects against local hardware failure.
* Work anywhere: the same repository can be used on multiple machines;
  you can work offline and synchronize later.
* Collaboration: multiple contributors can work safely without
  overwriting each other.
* Review: changes can be inspected and discussed before they are merged.

Once a local repository is connected to GitHub, only two commands are
needed for routine synchronization.

* `git push` uploads committed local changes to GitHub.
* `git pull` downloads changes from GitHub and integrates them locally.

### Authentication on GitHub (SSH)

GitHub requires authentication before it accepts `git push`. A common
method is SSH key authentication.

SSH uses a key pair.

* Private key: stays on your computer and must never be shared.
* Public key: added to your GitHub account to identify your computer.

Generate a key pair locally.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
The key pair will be stored in the `.ssh` folder in your home directory.


Display the public key.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the public key to your clipboard.

* macOS (Terminal):

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Windows (Git Bash):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

* Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

* Linux / WSL:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xclip
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key on GitHub.

* Profile menu --- Settings
* SSH and GPG keys --- New SSH key
* Paste the key and save

Test the connection.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

For up-to-date authentication, one may ask an AI assistant for help
for your operating system. For example:

* "How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub on Windows using Git Bash and
  verify that `git push` works?"

### Creating and Publishing a New Repository

This workflow applies only if you already have a local Git repository.
If not, create one first with `git init`.

First, create a new empty repository on GitHub (do not initialize it
with a README). Then connect your local repository to GitHub.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/example-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Here, `yourname` is your GitHub username and `example-repo` is the
repository name you chose on GitHub.

### Cloning an Existing Repository

Cloning is used when the repository already exists on GitHub.
Suppose that `someone` is the GitHub username or organization that owns
a repository called `project`. To clone this repository to your
own computer, first `cd` to the folder where you want put the repository
and then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:someone/project.git
```

Cloning creates a new local directory containing the full project
history.


## Python

Python is the most widely used programming language in modern data
science and an excellent first language for beginners. Its clean,
readable syntax allows students to focus on ideas rather than
punctuation, while its large ecosystem means that most common tasks
already have well-tested libraries. In this course, Python will be used
to write code, analyze data, and produce graphics. These skills form the
foundation for reproducible data science workflows introduced later in
the book.

Python has earned its central role because it balances power and
accessibility. The base language is expressive and easy to read, and
many core tools are included by default. Beyond that, widely used
libraries such as `pandas` for data analysis, `matplotlib` for
visualization, and `scikit-learn` for machine learning allow students to
move quickly from simple examples to realistic projects. While R is
also an excellent language, especially for statistics, Python will be
the default language in this book, with R treated as an optional
companion.

### Installing Python (Python 3.12)

We will use **Python 3.12**. At the time of writing, this version is
supported by major scientific and machine-learning libraries, including
TensorFlow and PyTorch. From the beginning, we use the command line to
install and manage software so that the workflow is transparent and
reproducible.

Choose the instructions for your operating system.

**Windows (using winget)**

Open **PowerShell** (not Git Bash) and run:

```
winget install Python.Python.3.12
```

After installation, close and reopen your terminal so that `python` is
available on the PATH.

**macOS (using Homebrew)**

If Homebrew is not installed, follow the instructions at
[https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

Then install Python 3.12 by running:

```
brew install python@3.12
```

Homebrew installs Python in a standard location and makes it available
from the terminal.

**Linux (Debian / Ubuntu using apt)**

These instructions assume a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system.

First update package information:

```
sudo apt update
```

Install Python 3.12 and the virtual environment module:

```
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv
```

Verify the installation:

```
python3.12 --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Python 3.12.x
```

If this command fails, resolve the installation before continuing.

### Creating a virtual environment

Virtual environments should be created in a deliberate and consistent
location. We recommend creating a dedicated directory in your home
folder to store environments for this course.

From a terminal, create a directory named `envs` in your home directory:

```
mkdir -p ~/envs
```

Create a virtual environment named `ds-env` inside this directory:

```
python -m venv ~/envs/ds-env
```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows (Git Bash):**

  ```
  source ~/envs/ds-env/Scripts/activate
  ```

* **macOS / Linux:**

  ```
  source ~/envs/ds-env/bin/activate
  ```

When the environment is active, your prompt will usually change to show
`(ds-env)`.

Upgrade the package manager and install a small set of core libraries:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

All Python packages for this course should be installed *inside* this
environment.

To leave the environment, run:

```
deactivate
```

### A short Python warm-up

Before moving on, you should be comfortable with:

* running Python from the command line,
* writing and executing simple scripts,
* using variables, lists, and loops,
* importing and using packages.

For a concise, **official** warm-up that can be completed in
**2--3 hours**, use the following resources from the Python
Documentation:

* *An Informal Introduction to Python*:
  [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)
* *More Control Flow Tools*:
  [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
* *Modules*:
  [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)

Read these sections in order. They provide just enough structure to
begin experimenting with Python and to learn additional features on
demand.

After completing this warm-up, you should be ready to work
interactively and write small scripts. The next section builds on this
foundation to introduce a reproducible data science workflow.

## Quarto: Reproducible Documents for Real Data Science

### Why Quarto?

Quarto is a tool for writing documents that combine text, code, figures,
and results in a single, executable source file. Instead of keeping
separate word-processor files, exported plots, screenshots, and loose
scripts, Quarto keeps analysis and narrative together and regenerates
results automatically whenever code or data change. This makes work
transparent, reproducible, and easier to review.

Quarto is widely used in data science for technical reports, notebooks,
and presentations where correctness and traceability matter. Compared
to traditional notebooks, Quarto emphasizes documents first and
interactivity second. Compared to Word or PowerPoint, it prioritizes
reproducible computation over manual formatting. These properties make
Quarto well suited for teaching and for real data science projects,
where reasoning and evidence are more important than appearance.

### Installation and setup (CLI-first)

Quarto is a command-line tool. We install and use it from the terminal,
independent of any editor.

**Windows (using winget)**

Open **PowerShell** and run:

```
winget install Quarto.Quarto
```

Close and reopen the terminal after installation.

**macOS (using Homebrew)**

```
brew install quarto
```

**Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install quarto
```

After installation, verify that Quarto is available:

```
quarto check
```

This command reports available engines (such as Python) and confirms
that Quarto is correctly installed.

**Editor support (optional)**

Quarto works entirely from the command line. If you use VS Code, you may
optionally install the **Quarto** extension for syntax highlighting and
convenience features. This is not required for rendering documents.

### Quarto and Python environments

Quarto does not manage Python installations or virtual environments.
When rendering a document, it uses the Python interpreter available on
your PATH.

For this course, you must activate your course environment *before*
running Quarto commands.

```
source ~/envs/ds-env/bin/activate
```

On Windows (Git Bash):

```
source ~/envs/ds-env/Scripts/activate
```

After activation, verify:

```
python --version
```

Quarto will now execute all Python code chunks using this environment.

### Anatomy of a Quarto file

A Quarto document (`.qmd`) has three main components, executed from top
to bottom during rendering.

**YAML header**

The YAML header appears at the top of the file between `---` lines and
controls document-level settings such as title and output format.

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
---
```

**Markdown body**

The body contains text written in Markdown: headings, paragraphs, lists,
links, and mathematical notation. This is where you explain your
analysis and interpret results.

**Code chunks**

Code chunks contain executable code. During rendering, Quarto runs the
code and inserts the output directly into the document. In this course,
we use Python by default.

print("Hello, Quarto")

### First reproducible notebook

A minimal workflow for your first Quarto document is:

* create a source file,
* write text and code together,
* render the document from the command line.

Create a new file named `my_first.qmd` with the following header:

```yaml
---
title: "My First Quarto Notebook"
format: html
---
```

Add a short paragraph:

```markdown
This document demonstrates a simple, reproducible analysis written in
Python using Quarto.
```

Before running this example, make sure the required plotting library
is installed in your active environment:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

Insert a Python code chunk that produces a figure:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
plt.title("A Simple Plot")
plt.show()

Activate your environment and render:

```
source ~/envs/ds-env/bin/activate
quarto render my_first.qmd
```

This produces an HTML file that contains the text, code, and generated
output.

### Exercises

* Create a new `.qmd` file titled *My First Quarto Notebook*.
* Add a YAML header specifying an HTML output format.
* Write one paragraph describing the purpose of the notebook.
* Add a Python code chunk that generates a figure.
* Render the document to HTML from the command line.
* Modify the code, re-render, and confirm that the output updates
  automatically.
* Delete the rendered HTML file and regenerate it from the `.qmd`
  source.

These steps reinforce the core idea of reproducibility: results are
always generated from source, not copied or pasted.


## Your Editing Home: Visual Studio Code

### What an IDE Is and Why VS Code

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) brings together tools for
editing files, running code, and organizing projects in a single
place. Unlike simple editors such as Notepad or TextEdit, an IDE
understands project structure, highlights syntax, reports errors, and
integrates directly with version control and command-line tools.

VS Code

* Unified editor for text, code, and documents
* Integrated terminal for Git, Python, R, and Quarto
* Built-in file explorer and project navigation
* Extension system for language and tool support
* Native Git integration for version-controlled work

These features support a project-based, reproducible workflow rather
than scattered scripts and files.

### Installation and Setup

If VS Code is not yet installed, download it from the official website
at [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install the version for your
operating system. On Windows, choose the System Installer (64-bit) and
follow the default steps. On macOS, you may install it from the same
website or via Homebrew using

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

After installation, open VS Code and confirm that it can see the tools
you installed earlier. Open the integrated terminal (*View → Terminal*)
and run

```bash
git --version
python --version
quarto --version
```

If these commands run successfully, VS Code is correctly connected to
your existing setup.

Next, install a small set of extensions that support data science
workflows. Use the Extensions icon in the sidebar or open the command
palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and choose “Extensions: Install
Extensions.”

* Python — Editing support, autocomplete, linting, debugging, and
  notebook integration for Python.
* R — Editing and execution support for R scripts.
* GitLens — Enhanced Git history, blame, and comparison tools.
* Quarto — Authoring and previewing Quarto documents.
* Markdown Shortcuts — Convenient commands for Markdown and Quarto
  editing.

These extensions do not install Python, R, Git, or Quarto; they only
connect VS Code to tools you already installed.

### Integrated Terminal and Shell Choice

VS Code includes a built-in terminal so you can run command-line tools
inside the editor. This avoids switching between separate terminal
windows and keeps all work in one place. Open the terminal with *View →
Terminal* or Ctrl+` (Control + backtick).

On Windows, it is often preferable to use Git Bash rather than
PowerShell so that commands match those used in class. After installing
Git for Windows, open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P),
choose “Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON),” and add

```json
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash"
```

Restart the terminal. You can now run commands such as `cd`, `ls`,
`git status`, and `quarto render` in a Unix-like environment directly
inside VS Code.

### Working with Projects in VS Code

A core habit in VS Code is opening folders rather than individual
files. When you open a folder, VS Code treats it as a project: it
tracks files, recognizes structure, and enables Git integration. This
is essential for reproducible data science work.

Use *File → Open Folder* and select your project directory, such as
`ds4hs/`. The sidebar then shows your files, Git status, and search
tools in one place. The command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) provides
fast access to nearly all VS Code features without navigating menus.
VS Code also supports split editors for side-by-side viewing and works
well for Markdown and Quarto documents.

### Good Practices

* Always open a project folder (for example, `ds4hs/`) rather than
  individual files.
* Keep all work in plain text: scripts, notes, and Quarto documents.
* Use the integrated terminal for Git, Python, and Quarto commands.
* Enable autosave and consider format-on-save for consistent files.
* Avoid storing work on the desktop; keep everything inside your
  project directory.

### Exercises

* Open the `ds4hs` folder in VS Code using *File → Open Folder*.
* Open the integrated terminal and confirm `git --version` works.
* Create a new Markdown file and write a short paragraph in it.
* Use the command palette to install one extension.
* Run `ls` in the terminal and verify that it lists your project files.



## Putting It All Together: Your First Data Science Project

This chapter integrates everything from Part I—command line, VS Code,
Git, GitHub, Quarto, and Python/R—into a single, coherent project
workflow. The goal is to let students experience how real data science
work is done: create a clean folder, version it with Git, write a
reproducible Quarto file, and share the final analysis.

### Choosing a Simple, Meaningful Dataset

The first step in any project is choosing a dataset that is small,
clean, and intrinsically interesting. Students should select something
they care about so they remain motivated while practicing the
workflow.
Good examples include:

- NYC 311 complaint counts for a single neighborhood
- School lunch nutrition data from USDA open data
- A small sports dataset (NBA scores, soccer goals, WNBA box scores)
- Trends in daily steps from a personal fitness tracker
- Any two-column CSV they record themselves (date + measurement)

Best practice is to avoid large, messy datasets for this first
project.
Students should aim to complete end-to-end analysis, not get stuck in
heavy cleaning.

### Setting Up the Project Folder

A clean folder structure helps keep the project reproducible and
organized. Students use the command line to create folders and set up
a
Git repository.

Recommended structure:

- `data/` — raw datasets in CSV or JSON
- `analysis/` — Quarto notebooks
- `figures/` — automatically generated plots
- `README.md` — short description of the project

Key steps:

- Use the command line to create the folder and subfolders  
  *(mkdir ds4hs-project, cd ds4hs-project, mkdir data analysis
figures)*
- Initialize Git with  
  `git init`
- Make the first commit with  
  `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial project structure"`

Students should verify that Git is tracking the project by running
`git status` and confirming the working tree is clean.

### Writing a Full Quarto Analysis

The core of the project is a reproducible Quarto notebook that
explains
the data, code, and conclusions in one document. The notebook should
include:

- A clear statement of the question (e.g., “How do 311 noise complaints
  differ between weekdays and weekends?”)
- Code to import the dataset
- Two or three meaningful visualizations (bar plots, line plots,
  scatterplots, histograms)
- Short summary paragraphs explaining the patterns

A minimal workflow:

1. Create `analysis/project.qmd` in VS Code.
2. Add a YAML header with a title, author, and format.
3. Insert code chunks to load the dataset and inspect its structure.
4. Generate plots and save outputs to the `figures/` folder.
5. Render the notebook to HTML using the VS Code Quarto extension.

Students should keep text and code in one place—not separate
PowerPoints, Word files, or screenshots. Quarto ensures everything is
reproducible.

### Publishing or Sharing Work

Once the analysis renders cleanly, students can make the project
public
(or share privately).

Options include:

- Push the project to GitHub with  
  `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`
- Share the rendered HTML via a GitHub repository
- Optionally, enable GitHub Pages so the report becomes a public website
  at
  `https://username.github.io/ds4hs-project`

This final step completes the full data science cycle: version
control,
reproducible notebook, and public sharing.

### Exercises

- Choose one dataset from the list above (or another small dataset that
  interests you). Add it to the `data/` folder.
- Build the full folder structure using only the command line.
- Initialize a Git repository and make at least two commits: one for the
  structure and one for adding your dataset.
- Create a Quarto notebook that loads the data and produces at least two
  visualizations.
- Push your finished project to GitHub and share the link with your
  class.
