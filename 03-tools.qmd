# Right Tools for Data Science Projects

## Introduction

This chapter introduces the tools required to carry out reproducible data
science projects in this course. A reproducible project is one in which the
full analysis --- data inputs, code, narrative, and results --- can be rerun
by someone else, or by the same analyst at a later time, with the same
outcomes. Reproducibility is therefore a property of an entire project rather
than of any single tool. The goal of this chapter is not to teach tools in
isolation, but to explain how a small set of tools work together to support
this project-level reproducibility.


Without a structured workflow, data science work tends to become fragile.
Files are renamed or overwritten, intermediate results are lost, and analysis
steps are no longer clear even to the original author. These problems become
more severe as projects grow in size or involve collaboration. In an academic
setting, they also make it difficult to review, grade, or extend work. The
tools introduced in this chapter are motivated by these common failure modes
and are chosen to prevent them in a systematic way.


The tools in this chapter form a coherent workflow rather than a loose
collection of software. Git records the history of a project and makes changes
explicit. GitHub provides a shared location for storing, submitting, and
reviewing projects. Quarto allows code, text, and results to live in a single
executable document. Python or R provides the computational engine for data
analysis. VS Code serves as a coordinating environment that brings these tools
together in daily work. Each tool plays a distinct role, and reproducibility
emerges from their interaction.


In this course, all homework and projects are treated as reproducible data
science projects. Submissions consist of files organized in a clear directory
structure, tracked with version control, and rendered into reproducible
documents. Screenshots, manually edited outputs, and undocumented analysis
steps are not acceptable substitutes. By the end of this chapter, you should
be able to set up a complete project, make changes in a controlled way, and
produce results that can be reliably reproduced and reviewed.


## Git: Version Control for Reproducible Projects

### Why Git?

Version control is a foundational skill for data science because it treats
your work as a living project with a complete history. Git lets you track
every change you make, recover from mistakes, and collaborate without
overwriting anyone’s work. Unlike saving multiple file versions by hand
(e.g., `project_final_v12_REAL`), Git provides a precise, automatic timeline
of your edits. This makes your work reproducible, auditable, and shareable,
which are essential habits for scientific computing and data science
projects.

Git is used to manage data science projects as evolving artifacts rather than one-time snapshots. Analyses typically change as
data are cleaned, models are revised, and interpretations improve. A Git
repository should contain only the files needed to understand, reproduce,
and extend a project---nothing more.

### Installing Git

Git must be installed before it can be used. Use the method appropriate
for your system.

* **Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
```

This installs Git together with **Git Bash**, a terminal environment used
throughout this book. Do not run `winget` inside Git Bash.

* **macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install git
```

* **Debian / Ubuntu Linux (including WSL):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

After installation, configure Git once so your work is properly attributed:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Verify that Git is installed and configured correctly:

```bash
git --version
git config --list
```

### Essential Git Commands

Git is most effective when you stage files deliberately and keep the
repository clean. The following commands form the core of everyday Git
usage in data science projects.

* `git init` initializes a repository in a project folder.
* `git status` shows which files have changed.
* `git add <file>` stages selected files to be recorded.
* `git commit -m "message"` saves a snapshot of staged changes.
* `git diff` displays differences between versions.
* `git push` sends committed changes to a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub.
* `git pull` retrieves updates from a remote repository, such as one hosted on GitHub.

These two commands are where Git connects to an online platform. A common
example of such a platform is GitHub, which serves as a shared location
for backing up work and collaborating on projects. The next section focuses
on GitHub itself and how it is used in our workflow.


Avoid using `git add .` as a default habit. It often stages generated
files, temporary outputs, or other unintended content. Staging files
explicitly helps keep repositories small, readable, and reproducible.

### Basic Workflow

Git works best when your project is organized as a single folder containing
scripts, Quarto files, and documentation. A typical workflow follows a
simple cycle: edit files, inspect what changed, stage selected files, and
commit them with a short message explaining what was done.

```bash
cd ds4hs
git init
git status
git add README.md
git add analysis.qmd
git commit -m "initial project structure"
```

Git can also connect your local project to a remote repository hosted
online. This idea is introduced above when discussing `git push` and
`git pull`, and it is developed in detail in the next section, which
focuses on GitHub as a concrete example of an online hosting platform.


### Good Practices for Git

Good Git usage is less about memorizing commands and more about developing
clean, repeatable habits. The following practices are especially important
for reproducible data science projects:

* **Keep the repository clean.** Track only files that are needed to
  understand, reproduce, and extend the project. Avoid committing
  generated files, rendered outputs, large raw datasets, or temporary
  artifacts unless they are explicitly required.

* **Stage files deliberately.** Add files explicitly rather than staging
  everything at once. This helps prevent accidental inclusion of
  unnecessary or generated content.

* **Commit small, logical changes.** Each commit should represent a
  coherent step in the project, making the history easier to read and
  reason about.

* **Write informative commit messages.** A short message explaining what
  changed and why is more valuable than a vague description.

* **Use `.gitignore` consistently.** The `.gitignore` file is the primary
  mechanism for keeping a repository clean over time. It tells Git which
  files should never be tracked, such as temporary outputs, cache
  directories, and system-specific files.


## GitHub: Hosting and Collaboration for Git Projects

### What GitHub Is and Why It Matters

GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories. Git manages
project history on your computer, while GitHub stores a synchronized copy
online. GitHub adds four capabilities that local Git alone does not
provide.

* Backup: a remote copy protects against local hardware failure.
* Work anywhere: the same repository can be used on multiple machines;
  you can work offline and synchronize later.
* Collaboration: multiple contributors can work safely without
  overwriting each other.
* Review: changes can be inspected and discussed before they are merged.

Once a local repository is connected to GitHub, only two commands are
needed for routine synchronization.

* `git push` uploads committed local changes to GitHub.
* `git pull` downloads changes from GitHub and integrates them locally.

### Authentication on GitHub (SSH)

GitHub requires authentication before it accepts `git push`. A common
method is SSH key authentication.

SSH uses a key pair.

* Private key: stays on your computer and must never be shared.
* Public key: added to your GitHub account to identify your computer.

Generate a key pair locally.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
The key pair will be stored in the `.ssh` folder in your home directory.


Display the public key.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the public key to your clipboard.

* macOS (Terminal):

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

* Windows (Git Bash):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

* Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

* Linux / WSL:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xclip
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Add the public key on GitHub.

* Profile menu --- Settings
* SSH and GPG keys --- New SSH key
* Paste the key and save

Test the connection.

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

For up-to-date authentication, one may ask an AI assistant for help
for your operating system. For example:

* "How do I set up SSH keys for GitHub on Windows using Git Bash and
  verify that `git push` works?"

### Creating and Publishing a New Repository

This workflow applies only if you already have a local Git repository.
If not, create one first with `git init`.

First, create a new empty repository on GitHub (do not initialize it
with a README). Then connect your local repository to GitHub.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourname/example-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Here, `yourname` is your GitHub username and `example-repo` is the
repository name you chose on GitHub.

### Cloning an Existing Repository

Cloning is used when the repository already exists on GitHub.
Suppose that `someone` is the GitHub username or organization that owns
a repository called `project`. To clone this repository to your
own computer, first `cd` to the folder where you want put the repository
and then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:someone/project.git
```

Cloning creates a new local directory containing the full project
history.


## Your Editing Home: Visual Studio Code

### What an IDE Is and Why VS Code

A code editor is more than a place to type. An Integrated Development
Environment (IDE) brings together tools that help you write, run, and
organize code efficiently. Unlike simple editors such as Notepad or
TextEdit, an IDE understands your project structure, highlights
syntax,
suggests fixes, and connects directly to version control.

VS Code is widely used in data science because it is fast,
lightweight,
and highly customizable. It includes an integrated terminal, a built-
in
file explorer, and a rich extension system that adds support for
Python,
R, Git, Quarto, and Markdown. These features allow you to work
productively without switching between different applications.

### Installation and Setup

To install VS Code, visit the official website at
https://code.visualstudio.com and download the installer for your
operating system. On Windows, choose the **System Installer (64-bit)**
and follow the default installation steps. On macOS, you may download
the installer from the same page or install VS Code through Homebrew
using

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

After installation, open VS Code and add several key extensions that
support data-science work. You can install them by clicking the
Extensions icon in the sidebar or by opening the command palette
(Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and selecting “Extensions: Install Extensions.”

- **Python** — Provides autocomplete, linting, debugging, and notebook
  support for Python scripts.
- **R** — Adds tools for editing and running R code directly from VS
  Code.
- **GitLens** — Enhances the Git interface with commit history, blame
  information, and comparisons.
- **Quarto** — Enables authoring of reproducible documents, reports, and
  slides in Quarto.
- **Markdown Shortcuts** — Offers convenient formatting commands for
  Markdown and Quarto editing.

VS Code also includes a built-in terminal so you can run command-line
tools without switching windows. Open it by choosing *View → Terminal*
from the menu or by pressing Ctrl+` (Control + backtick). From there
you
can run commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `git status`, or `python` inside
your project.



On Windows, you may want VS Code to use **Git Bash** instead of
PowerShell.
After installing Git for Windows, open the command palette
(Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P), choose “Preferences: Open User Settings
(JSON),”
and add the following entry:

```json
"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Git Bash"
```

You can now run `cd`, `ls`, `git status`, and other commands in a
familiar
Unix-like environment directly inside VS Code.


### Navigating VS Code

A core habit in VS Code is opening a folder instead of individual
files.
When you open a folder as a project, VS Code tracks your files,
recognizes your structure, and keeps your work organized. This makes
it
easier to manage assignments, scripts, and datasets in one place.
The sidebar provides access to the file explorer, global search, and
version control. The command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) is one of
the
fastest ways to work, allowing you to run nearly any command without
searching through menus. VS Code also supports multiple editor panes
for
side-by-side editing, and it offers an excellent environment for
Markdown and Quarto documents.

### Best Practices

- Always work inside a project folder such as `ds4hs/`.
- Keep everything in plain text, including scripts, notes, and Quarto
  documents.
- Turn on autosave and consider enabling format-on-save for clean,
  consistent files.
- Avoid storing files on the desktop; keep all work organized under your
  project directory.

### Exercises

- Open the `ds4hs` folder in VS Code.
- Create a new Markdown file and write a short paragraph in it.
- Use the command palette to install an extension.
- Open the integrated terminal and run `ls` to view your project files.


## Quarto: Reproducible Documents for Real Data Science

### Why Quarto?

Quarto is the modern tool for writing documents that combine text,
code, figures, and results in one place. Instead of keeping separate
Word files, screenshots, exported plots, and loose scripts, Quarto
keeps everything together and reruns your analysis whenever data or
code change. This makes work transparent, reproducible, and easy to
review. Data scientists use Quarto because it replaces Word and
PowerPoint entirely for technical documents, reports, and notebooks,
and naturally forces better project habits. When teaching or doing
projects, Quarto helps your work look professional while keeping the
focus on reasoning and evidence rather than formatting.

### Installation and Setup

To use Quarto, you need two things:

- **Quarto CLI**  
  Download and install from
  https://quarto.org/docs/get-started
  This gives you the command-line tool `quarto` for rendering
  documents.
  After installation, verify:
  ```bash
  quarto check
  ```

- **Quarto Extension in VS Code**  
  Open the Extensions panel, search for **Quarto**, and install it.
  This adds syntax highlighting, preview tools, and convenient buttons
  for rendering.

- **Rendering formats**  
  With the extension installed, you can render a `.qmd` file directly
  to HTML or PDF using the “Render” button in VS Code or by running
  ```bash
  quarto render myfile.qmd
  ```  
  PDF output requires a LaTeX installation (TinyTeX or TeX Live); HTML
  works out of the box.

### Anatomy of a Quarto File

A basic Quarto document has three components:

- **YAML header**  
  Appears at the top between `---` lines and controls title, author,
  format, and other options.
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "My Document"
  format: html
  ---
  ```

- **Markdown body**  
  This is where you write text, using the same Markdown syntax you
  already know: headings, emphasis, lists, links, and so on.

- **Code chunks**  
  Code blocks that run during rendering and insert their results
  automatically. Quarto supports many languages.
  ```{r}
  1 + 1
  ```  
  ```{python}
  print("hello quarto")
  ```

### First Reproducible Notebook

A simple workflow for your first Quarto notebook:

1. Create a new file: `my_first.qmd`.
2. Add a YAML header, a few sentences of text, and a code chunk.
3. Add a small plot.
4. Render to HTML.

Example structure:

```yaml
---
title: "My First Quarto Notebook"
format: html
---
```

Write some text:

```markdown
This is my first Quarto document. Below is a simple plot created in
Python.
```

Insert a plot:

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])
plt.title("A Simple Plot")
plt.show()
```

Render using the VS Code “Render” button or:

```bash
quarto render my_first.qmd
```

### Exercises

- Create a new `.qmd` file titled “My First Quarto Notebook.”
- Add a YAML header with a title of your choice.
- Write one paragraph explaining what your notebook will show.
- Add a Python or R code chunk that produces a figure.
- Render to HTML and check that text, code, and output all appear.


## Python (and optionally R): Your First Programming Language

Python is the most widely used language in modern data science, and it
is an
excellent first language for high school students. Its clean syntax
allows
beginners to focus on ideas instead of punctuation, and its large
ecosystem
means almost anything you want to do already has a library that helps
you do
it. For our purposes, Python will serve as the main tool for writing
code,
analyzing data, producing graphics, and connecting all of these pieces
inside
a Quarto notebook.

### Why Python for High School Data Science

Python has earned its central place in data science because it
balances power
and readability. It comes with “batteries included,” meaning the basic
installation already provides many useful tools. Its syntax reads
almost like
English, making it easier to learn than most languages. Most
importantly, the
Python ecosystem is enormous — libraries like `pandas` for data
analysis,
`matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plots, and `scikit-learn` for machine
learning
allow students to progress quickly from small ideas to real
discoveries. While
R is also a strong choice, especially for statistics, this book will
use
Python as the default and treat R as an optional companion language.

### Installing Python

You have two reliable options for installation, and either one works
well in
practice.

* **Official Python installer (python.org)**
  Best if you prefer a clean, minimal installation.
  Steps:
  - Visit https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  - Download the version recommended for your system  
  - Run the installer and make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” on Windows

* **Anaconda distribution**
  Best if you want many scientific libraries already installed.
  Steps:
  - Visit https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution  
  - Download the installer for your system  
  - Install with the default recommended settings

After installation, verify that Python works by opening Git Bash or
Terminal
and typing:

```
python --version
```

You should see something like `Python 3.12.1`. If you see an error,
revisit the
installation steps.

### Learning the Basics

Python programming begins with building blocks. Students should spend
time in
a Quarto notebook writing small code chunks, running them, and
modifying them
to observe how the machine responds.

**Core building blocks to practice**
* Variables and basic types
  ```python
  x = 5
  name = "Ada"
  pi = 3.14159
  ```

* Lists
  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

* Dictionaries
  ```python
  student = {"name": "Hana", "grade": 10, "favorite_color": "blue"}
  ```

* Reading data
  Using `pandas` after installing it:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
  ```

* Simple visualization
  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot([1,2,3,4], [10, 15, 13, 17])
  plt.show()
  ```

### Jupyter vs Quarto Code Chunks (Use Quarto Only)

Python is often taught using Jupyter notebooks, but this book will use
**Quarto
notebooks exclusively**. Quarto lets you combine code, text, figures,
and
explanations in one source file that produces polished HTML or PDF
output. It
is more powerful, more reproducible, and easier to use with version
control.

A sample Quarto Python chunk:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data/example.csv")
df.head()
```

Students should write, run, and document their work entirely within
Quarto.
This reinforces good habits from the beginning and keeps every project
reproducible.

### Exercises

* Create a new Quarto document and write a few Python lines that
define
  variables, lists, and dictionaries.
* Install Python and verify your installation with `python --version`.
* Read a small CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and plot one column.
* Modify the sample plot code to change colors, labels, or data.
* Add a short paragraph in your Quarto file describing what you
learned.


## Putting It All Together: Your First Data Science Project

This chapter integrates everything from Part I—command line, VS Code,
Git, GitHub, Quarto, and Python/R—into a single, coherent project
workflow. The goal is to let students experience how real data science
work is done: create a clean folder, version it with Git, write a
reproducible Quarto file, and share the final analysis.

### Choosing a Simple, Meaningful Dataset

The first step in any project is choosing a dataset that is small,
clean, and intrinsically interesting. Students should select something
they care about so they remain motivated while practicing the
workflow.
Good examples include:

- NYC 311 complaint counts for a single neighborhood
- School lunch nutrition data from USDA open data
- A small sports dataset (NBA scores, soccer goals, WNBA box scores)
- Trends in daily steps from a personal fitness tracker
- Any two-column CSV they record themselves (date + measurement)

Best practice is to avoid large, messy datasets for this first
project.
Students should aim to complete end-to-end analysis, not get stuck in
heavy cleaning.

### Setting Up the Project Folder

A clean folder structure helps keep the project reproducible and
organized. Students use the command line to create folders and set up
a
Git repository.

Recommended structure:

- `data/` — raw datasets in CSV or JSON
- `analysis/` — Quarto notebooks
- `figures/` — automatically generated plots
- `README.md` — short description of the project

Key steps:

- Use the command line to create the folder and subfolders  
  *(mkdir ds4hs-project, cd ds4hs-project, mkdir data analysis
figures)*
- Initialize Git with  
  `git init`
- Make the first commit with  
  `git add .` and `git commit -m "Initial project structure"`

Students should verify that Git is tracking the project by running
`git status` and confirming the working tree is clean.

### Writing a Full Quarto Analysis

The core of the project is a reproducible Quarto notebook that
explains
the data, code, and conclusions in one document. The notebook should
include:

- A clear statement of the question (e.g., “How do 311 noise complaints
  differ between weekdays and weekends?”)
- Code to import the dataset
- Two or three meaningful visualizations (bar plots, line plots,
  scatterplots, histograms)
- Short summary paragraphs explaining the patterns

A minimal workflow:

1. Create `analysis/project.qmd` in VS Code.
2. Add a YAML header with a title, author, and format.
3. Insert code chunks to load the dataset and inspect its structure.
4. Generate plots and save outputs to the `figures/` folder.
5. Render the notebook to HTML using the VS Code Quarto extension.

Students should keep text and code in one place—not separate
PowerPoints, Word files, or screenshots. Quarto ensures everything is
reproducible.

### Publishing or Sharing Work

Once the analysis renders cleanly, students can make the project
public
(or share privately).

Options include:

- Push the project to GitHub with  
  `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`
- Share the rendered HTML via a GitHub repository
- Optionally, enable GitHub Pages so the report becomes a public website
  at
  `https://username.github.io/ds4hs-project`

This final step completes the full data science cycle: version
control,
reproducible notebook, and public sharing.

### Exercises

- Choose one dataset from the list above (or another small dataset that
  interests you). Add it to the `data/` folder.
- Build the full folder structure using only the command line.
- Initialize a Git repository and make at least two commits: one for the
  structure and one for adding your dataset.
- Create a Quarto notebook that loads the data and produces at least two
  visualizations.
- Push your finished project to GitHub and share the link with your
  class.
