# What Is Data Science?

Data science is the practice of learning from data. It brings together
three pillars—computation, statistics, and domain knowledge—to create
insights that help us understand, predict, and improve the world around
us. You have already seen data science in action many times without
noticing it.

- When your music app recommends a new artist, data science is working.
- When a weather app predicts tomorrow’s temperature, data science is
  working.
- When a city publishes flooding complaints or bus-delay patterns, data
  science helps make sense of them.

This chapter introduces what data science is and what it is not, setting
the stage for the hands-on tools you will learn in Part I.

## Data Science Is About Asking Questions

Every data science project begins with a question.

Why has traffic increased on my school’s street?  
Do certain neighborhoods file more noise complaints?  
Which players contributed most to a team’s winning season?

Data science helps translate these questions into something we can
analyze, measure, and explain.

## Data Science Uses Tools, Not Just Math

While math is important for deeper understanding, data scientists spend
much of their time using tools—command line, Git, VS Code, Quarto, and
programming languages such as Python or R. These tools help you:

- load and clean data
- organize your work
- build reproducible workflows
- create visualizations
- share results with others

This book starts with tools because tools give you the power to actually
_do_ data science. Once you know how to work with your computer the way
data scientists do, everything else becomes easier.

## Data Science Is Reproducible

A key idea in this book is reproducibility. A reproducible workflow is
one where:

- your analysis is neatly organized
- every step is documented
- results can be reproduced exactly by you or anyone else

This is why you will learn Quarto for writing reports and Git for
version control. These skills turn your projects into something
professional, even as a beginner.

## Data Science Is Interdisciplinary

To answer real-world questions, you combine:

- **computing** — writing code to process data
- **statistics** — measuring uncertainty and learning patterns
- **domain knowledge** — understanding the context: climate, health,
  sports, education, city systems, and many others

None of these pillars works alone. Together they create meaningful
insights.

## What You Will Learn Next

Part I of this book focuses on building your foundation:

- using the command line
- navigating your computer
- creating projects with clean structure
- using VS Code as your editing home
- tracking your work with Git
- writing analyses with Quarto
- learning your first programming language (Python)

By the end of Part I, you will have built your first complete data
science project: a real report, with real data, that you can publish or
share.

Part II takes you through case studies in health, environment, sports,
and other areas—helping you discover patterns in real datasets and
understand how data science works in practice.

Data science is not something you learn in one day. It is a craft you
build over time. This book gives you the tools and the mindset to begin
that journey the right way.
